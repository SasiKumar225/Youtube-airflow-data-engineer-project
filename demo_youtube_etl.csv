@roy601912008,"I completed the entire project today and I'm excited to learn more!

I overcame the challenges below and cleared the project:
1. kafka outdated version -> install 3.6.1 instead
2. Java version was also old so I install newer version using this command: sudo yum install java-17-devel
3. Servers run got stuck (Zookeeper and Kafka) -> I rebooted my EC2 server from the AWS EC2 instance console
4. S3 credential issue in KafkaConsumer notebook-> solve it by specifying the access key and secret inside S3FileSystem
5. Got invalid bucket name error (I 'm pretty damn sure the name is legit) when I tried to write to S3 --> it turns out I forgot the "":"" in between 's3' and '//' for my s3 bucket path......so be careful of typo

Finally, I was able to achieve the same result at last!! Thank you Darshil for the video!",2024-01-26T23:59:37Z

It’s been couple of months, I am trying to learn kafka. But found other tutorials too difficult as others are explaining it like its a rocket sceience. This is the best video to start kafka as a beginner. Thanks a lot. 

However I have a question, currently am working on a real project as a tableau developer. My data source is Athena and this project has almost same data pipeline. Now my problem is in athena table there are almost 20 columns but 2 of them are nested(every cell in those 2 columns contain long json object).  As a result I am unable to consume this 2 columns in Tableau. So do you have any solution that crawler can transform that nested columns before it stores in Athena table. 

I think problem is in producer, it is creating nested json file in the beginning , and crawler is producing table from that nested json file. As a result all attributes with no sub-attributes are in separated columns but attributes having another layer of attributes are getting nested in one column. I want sub-attributes of attributes in separate columns in Athena. I am not authorised to make any change on Kafka pipeline of my project but I have assesse of s3 and glue crawler.",2023-08-02T20:41:02Z
